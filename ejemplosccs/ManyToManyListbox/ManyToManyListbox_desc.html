<h1>Updating Many-to-Many via Multi-Select ListBox</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This example shows how to implement a sample record form that allows users 
  to assign multiple employees to a project using a multi-select ListBox. This 
  is an example of a many-to-many relationship whereby one project can have many 
  employees and one employee can have many projects.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To assign employees to an existing project, select a project from the list 
  to the left then select multiple employees from the multi-select ListBox. You 
  can select multiple employees by holding the CTRL key then clicking on each 
  employee you want to add to the selection. When done, click “Submit” to save 
  the selection.</p>
<p>To add a new project and assign employees to it, click the “Add New” link then 
  in the 'Add/Edit Project' form, type in a name for the new project then select 
  the employees you want to assign to the project. When done, click &quot;Submit&quot; 
  to save the new record.</p>
<h2>Steps to recreate</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a HTML table with two columns.
  <li>In the left cell of the HTML table, use the <strong>Grid Builder</strong> to create the
  grid based on the "Projects" table and its two columns: <em>project_id</em> and <em>project_name</em>.
  <li>Change the <em>project_name</em> field type from Label to Link, then set the 
    current page as the page name in its <strong>Href Source</strong> property. 
    Also add a Link Parameter with the following property values: <strong>Data 
    Source Type</strong>&nbsp;= <em>DataSource Column</em>, <strong>Parameter 
    Source</strong> = <em>project_id</em> and <strong>Parameter Name</strong> = <em>project_id</em>. 
  <li>In the bottom row of the Grid, add a <em><strong>Add New</strong></em> Link 
    control and set it's <strong>Href Source</strong> property to the current 
    page and add the text <em>project_id</em> into the <strong>Remove Parameters</strong> property. 
  <li>In the right cell of the HTML table, use the <strong>Record Builder</strong> to create the 
    'projects_rec' record form with the <em>project_name</em> field.
  <li>Enter <em>project_id</em> in the <strong>Remove Parameters</strong> property of
    the record form. 
  <li>Insert a new row into the record form (select "Insert row" from the 
   context menu which appears for the mouse right-click) and move it below the 
    <em>project_name</em> control (ALT + Arrow Down ). 
  <li>In the left cell of the new row, enter the text 'Employees' then in the right cell, 
    add a ListBox control called <em>employee_list</em>. 
  <li>Under the Format tab of the Properties window, activate the <strong>multiple</strong> property 
    of the <em>employee_list</em> ListBox and set its <strong>Size</strong> property to 8.
  <li>Switch to HTML mode and locate the code for the <em>employee_list</em> ListBox 
    then delete the &lt;option&gt; tag for the default 'Select Value' option (i.e. 
    &lt;option value=&quot;&quot; selected&gt;Select Value&lt;/option&gt;).
  <li>Switch back to Design mode and for the <em>employee_list</em> ListBox, set 
    the <strong>Connection</strong> property to&nbsp;<em>IntranetDB</em>&nbsp; and select&nbsp;<em>employees 
    </em> in the <strong>Data Source</strong> property. Select <em>emp_id </em>in the <strong>Bound 
    Column</strong> property, <em>emp_name</em> in the <strong>Text Column</strong> Property 
    and <em>Integer </em>in the <strong>Data Type</strong> property. Also set the <strong>Source 
    Type</strong> property to <em>Code Expression</em>. 
  <li>Add the appropriate programming code into <strong>Before Show</strong>, <strong>After Insert</strong>, 
    <strong>After Update</strong> and <strong>Before Delete</strong> events of the record form as 
    shown in the example. Note that you also need to copy the function <em>ProjectEmployeesModify</em>, 
    which should to be added anywhere in the event file, preferably between Events. 
  <li>Make cosmetic changes as needed, by modifying the text and captions within 
    the HTML.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Database Tables used</h2>
<p>Database: <em>Intranet</em></p>
<p>Tables: <em>projects, employees, projects_employees</em></p>
<h2>Events used</h2>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>Before Show</em></strong> event is used to retrieve the existing 
  database values and select the appropriate values for the multi-select ListBox 
  before the page is displayed.</p>
<p>The <em>ProjectEmployeesModify</em> function is used to simplify the updates 
  performed by the events below.</p>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>After Update</em></strong> event is used to retrieve the 
  ListBox values and update the many-to-many relationship table, in this case 
  <em>projects_employees</em>.</p>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>After Insert</em></strong> event is used to obtain the last 
  inserted key and update the many-to-many relationship table when a new record 
  is added by a user. 
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in">Note: you can use several methods to retrieve 
  the value of the last key inserted into the database, which is the current <em>project_id</em>. 
  Although many databases have appropriate functions for retrieving the last inserted 
  key within the current session, some databases do not support this. As such, 
  you can simply retrieve the highest key value in the table and assume that it 
  is the key last inserted by the current user. This method can be improved to 
  be more reliable, though this is not the purpose of this example.</p>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>Before Delete</em></strong> event is used to delete records 
  from the many-to-many relationship table whenever a project is deleted.</p>
