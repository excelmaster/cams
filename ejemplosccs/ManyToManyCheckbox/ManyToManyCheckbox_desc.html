<h1>Updating Many-to-Many Relations via CheckBox List</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This example shows how to implement a sample record form that allows users 
  to assign multiple employees to a project using a CheckBox List control. This 
  is an example of a many-to-many relationship whereby one project can have many 
  employees and one employee can have many projects.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To assign projects to an existing employee, select the employee from the list 
  to the left then select multiple projects by checking the corresponding checkboxes. 
  When done, click “Submit” to save the selection.</p>
<p>To add a new employee and assign projects to him\her, click the “Add New” link 
  then in the 'Add/Edit Employees' form, type in a name for the new employee then 
  select the projects you want to assign the employee to. When done, click &quot;Submit&quot; 
  to save the new record.</p>
<h2>Steps to recreate</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a HTML table with two columns.
  <li>In the left cell of the HTML table, use the <strong>Grid Builder</strong> to create the
  grid based on the "Employees" table and its two columns: <em>emp_id</em> and <em>emp_name</em>.
  <li>Convert the <em>emp_name</em> field to a Link field that points to the current 
    page and add a Link Parameter with the following values:
  <strong>Data Source Type</strong> = <em>DataSource Column</em>, <strong>Parameter Source</strong>&nbsp;= <em>emp_id</em>
  and <strong>Parameter name</strong> = <em>emp_id</em>. (Use the <strong>Href Source</strong> property).
  <li>In the bottom row of the Grid, add a <em><strong>Add New</strong></em> Link 
    control and set it's <strong>Href Source</strong> property to the current 
    page and add the text <em>emp_id</em> into the <strong>Remove Parameters</strong> property. 
  <li>In the right cell of the HTML table, use the <strong>Record Builder</strong> to create the 
    'Add/Edit Employee' record form with the <em>emp_name</em> field. 
  <li>Enter <em>emp_id</em> in the <strong>Remove Parameters</strong> property of
    the record form. 
  <li>Insert a new row into the record form and move it below the row with the 
    <em>emp_name</em> control (ALT + Arrow Down ). In the left cell of the new row, 
    enter the text 'Projects' then in the right cell, add a CheckBox List control 
    called <em>ProjectList</em>. 
  <li>For the CheckBox List, set the <strong>Connection</strong> property to&nbsp;<em>IntranetDB</em>&nbsp; 
    and select&nbsp;projects in the <strong>Data Source</strong> property. Select <em>project_id 
    </em>in the <strong>Bound Column</strong> property, <em>project_name</em> in the 
    <strong>Text Column</strong> Property and <em>Integer </em>in the <strong>Data Type</strong> 
    property. Also set the <strong>Source Type</strong> property to <em>Code Expression</em>.
  <li>Add the appropriate programming code into the <strong>Before Show</strong>, <strong>After 
    Insert</strong>, <strong>After Update</strong> and <strong>Before Delete</strong> events of the record 
    form as shown in the example.<br>
    Note that you also need to copy the function <em>ProjectEmployeesModify</em>, 
    which should to be added anywhere in the event file, preferably between Events. 
  <li>Make cosmetic changes as needed, by modifying the text and captions within 
    the HTML.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Database Tables used</h2>
<p>Database: <em>Intranet</em></p>
<p>Tables: <em>projects, employees, projects_employees</em></p>
<h2>Events used</h2>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>Before Show</em></strong> event is used to retrieve the existing 
  database values and select the appropriate values for the CheckBox List before 
  the page is displayed.</p>
<p>The <em>ProjectEmployeesModify</em> function is used to simplify the updates 
  performed by the events below.</p>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>After Update</em></strong> event is used to retrieve the 
  CheckBox List values and update the many-to-many relationship table, in this 
  case <em>projects_employees</em>.</p>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>After Insert</em></strong> event is used to obtain the last 
  inserted key and update the many-to-many relationship table when a new record 
  is added by a user. 
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in">Note: you can use several methods to retrieve 
  the value of the last key inserted into the database, which is the current <em>project_id</em>. 
  Although many databases have appropriate functions for retrieving the last inserted 
  key within the current session, some databases do not support this. As such, 
  you can simply retrieve the highest key value in the table and assume that it 
  is the key last inserted by the current user. This method can be improved to 
  be more reliable, though this is not the purpose of this example.</p>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>Before Delete</em></strong> event is used to delete records 
  from the many-to-many relationship table whenever a project is deleted.</p>
