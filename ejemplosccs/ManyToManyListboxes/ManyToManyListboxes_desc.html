<h1>Updating Many-to-Many Relations via Two Listboxes</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This example shows how to implement a sample record form that allows users 
  to assign multiple projects to an employee using two Listboxes. This is an example 
  of a many-to-many relationship whereby one employee can have many projects and 
  one project can have many employees.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To assign projects to an employee, select an employee from the list to the 
  left, then select multiple projects by holding the CTRL key and clicking on 
  the project in the list. Click on the "&gt;&gt;" button to move projects to 
  the 'Assigned projects' list. Note that can also remove projects from 'Assigned 
  projects' by selecting them and clicking on the "&lt;&lt;" button. When done, 
  click “Submit” to save the selection.</p>
<p>To add a new employee and assign projects to him\her, click the "Add New" link 
  and enter the name of the employee in the 'Employee' field, then assign the 
  projects as described above . When done, click &quot;Submit&quot; to save the 
  new record.</p>
<h2>Steps to recreate</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a HTML table with two columns.
  <li>In the left cell of the HTML table, use the <strong>Grid Builder</strong> to create the
  grid based on the "Employees" table and its two columns: <em>emp_id</em> and <em>emp_name</em>.
  <li>Convert the <em>emp_name</em> field to a Link field that points to the current 
    page and passes the value of <em>emp_id</em> as a URL parameter. (Use the 
    <strong>Href Source</strong> property).
  <li>In the bottom row of the Grid, add a <em><strong>Add New</strong></em> Link 
    control and set it's <strong>Href Source</strong> property to the current 
    page and add the text <em>emp_id</em> into the <strong>Remove Parameters</strong> property. 
  <li>In the right cell of the HTML table, use the Record Builder to create a 
    record form with one <em>emp_name</em> field. 
  <li>Enter <em>emp_id</em> in the <strong>Remove Parameters</strong> property of
    the record form. 
  <li>Insert a new row into the record form and move it below the row with the 
    <em>emp_name</em> control.
  <li>Within the new row, add a HTML table with three columns. In the first and 
    last column, add two ListBox controls (named <em>AvailableListBox </em>and 
    <em>LinkedListBox </em>respectively) and in the middle column, add two buttons 
    (named <em>RightButton</em> and <em>LeftButton</em> respectively)
  <li>Under the Format tab of the Properties window, activate the <strong>multiple</strong> property 
    of the two ListBox controls and set their <strong>Size</strong> property to 8. 
  <li>Switch to HTML mode and locate the code for both ListBox controls then delete 
    the &lt;option&gt; tag for the default 'Select Value' option (i.e. &lt;option 
    value=&quot;&quot; selected&gt;Select Value&lt;/option&gt;).
  <li> For the <em>AvailableListBox </em>ListBox, set the <strong>Connection</strong> property 
    to&nbsp;<em>IntranetDB</em>&nbsp; and select&nbsp;<em>projects</em> in the 
    <strong>Data Source</strong> property. Select <em>project_id </em>in the <strong>Bound Column</strong> 
    property, <em>project_name</em> in the <strong>Text Column</strong> Property and 
    <em>Integer </em>in the <strong>Data Type</strong> property. Also set the <strong>Source 
    Type</strong> property to <em>Code Expression</em>. <br>
In the Format tab of the <strong>Properties</strong> window, set the <strong>Id</strong> property to <em>available.</em> 

  <li>For the <em>LinkedListBox </em>ListBox, open the 'Data Source' window by 
    clicking on the [...] button next to the <strong>Data Source</strong> property, 
    then click on the "Build Query" button and select the following tables: 'projects' 
    and 'project_employees'. Select [*] (all fields) in the 'projects' table and 
    unselect all fields in the 'projects_employees' table. 
  <li>While still in the 'Data Source' window, add a Where parameter of the form: 
    <em>emp_id</em> equals(=) <em>emp_id</em> with the <strong>Parameter Source</strong> 
    Type set to <em>URL</em> and the <strong>Default Value</strong> set to <em>-1</em>.
  <li>Close the 'Data Source' window then with the <em>LinkedListBox </em>ListBox 
    still selected, select <em>project_id </em>in the <strong>Bound Column</strong> 
    property, <em>project_name</em> in the <strong>Text Column</strong> Property and 
    <em>Integer </em>in the <strong>Data Type</strong> property. Also set the <strong>Source 
    Type</strong> property to <em>Code Expression</em>. 
  <li>Within the record form, add a Hidden control called <em>LinkedID</em>.
  <li>Add Custom code to the <strong>On Click</strong> client event of the<em> RightButton</em> 
    and <em>LeftButton</em> buttons as shown in the example.
  <li>Add Custom code to the <strong>On Submit</strong> client event of the record form as shown 
    in the example.
  <li>Add the appropriate programming code into the <strong>After Insert</strong>, <strong>After 
    Update</strong> and <strong>Before Delete</strong> events of the record form and the <strong>Before 
    Build Select</strong> event of the <em>AvailableListBox </em>ListBox as shown in 
    the example. Note that you also need to copy the function <em>ProjectEmployeesModify</em>, 
    which should to be added anywhere in the event file, preferably between Events. 
  <li>Make cosmetic changes as needed, by modifying the text and captions within 
    the HTML.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Database Tables used</h2>
<p>Database: <em>Intranet</em></p>
<p>Tables: <em>projects, employees, projects_employees</em></p>
<h2>Programming Notes</h2>
<p>The <strong><em>Before Build Select</em></strong> event of the <em>AvailableListBox </em>ListBox 
  is used to show only the projects bound to the current employee.</p>
<p>The <em>ProjectEmployeesModify</em> function is used to simplify the updates 
  performed by the events below.</p>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>After Update</em></strong> event is used to retrieve the 
  ListBox values and update the many-to-many relationship table, in this case 
  <em>projects_employees</em>.</p>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>After Insert</em></strong> event is used to obtain the last 
  inserted key and update the many-to-many relationship table when a new record 
  is added by a user. 
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt 0.5in">Note: you can use several methods to retrieve 
  the value of the last key inserted into the database, which is the current <em>project_id</em>. 
  Although many databases have appropriate functions for retrieving the last inserted 
  key within the current session, some databases do not support this. As such, 
  you can simply retrieve the highest key value in the table and assume that it 
  is the key last inserted by the current user. This method can be improved to 
  be more reliable, though this is not the purpose of this example.</p>
<p>The record form's <strong><em>Before Delete</em></strong> event is used to delete records 
  from the many-to-many relationship table whenever a project is deleted.</p>
